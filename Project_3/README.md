# Project 3# README
Project 3 focuses on implementing a Chord: P2P System and Simulation

# Note
There are two directories included. To use the Pony Crypto package (allows for using SHA256 for consistent hashing) the installation of corral and compilation of the Pony program must use Corral.
Therefore the directory "Insert Directory Name" uses the Crypto package and compiles using ``` corral run -- ponyc ```. The other directory, "Insert Other Directory Name", does not use external packages and compiles using ```ponyc```
