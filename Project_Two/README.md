# Project 2 README
Project two focuses on Gossip algorithms. Gossip algorithms can be utilized for both group communication and aggregate computational tasks. The goal of this project is to determine the convergence of both rumor propogation and push-sum algorithms using simulations in Pony. Since actors in Pony are fully asynchronous, Asynchronous Gossip is used to accomplish this task.
